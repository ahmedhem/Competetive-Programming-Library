• n items can be arranged in n! ways.
• Number ways you can select k of n items:
{ Permutations: when order matters
nPk = n! / (n − k)!
{ Combinations: when order is unimportant
nCk = nk = n!/(n-k)!k!
nCk = choose(n,k)
NCK %mod= N!/(n-k)!k! %mod = N!%mod*(mod inverse)

very important discussion

-
get the max distance from every ndoe to anoter:
let the  root = x;
Get the distance from the roof to every node and store it .
the node with max distance from x, we will call it y.
Make another bfs from y to every node and store the distance in another array.
for every node i, the maximum distance from it to any node is the max of arrayx[i],arrayy[i]
